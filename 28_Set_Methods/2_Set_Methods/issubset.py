# issubset():
# The issubset() method checks if all the items of the original set are present in the particular set. 
# It returns True if all the items are present, else it returns False.

# Example:
cities = {"Tokyo", "Madrid", "Berlin", "Delhi"}
cities2 = {"Delhi", "Madrid"}
print(cities2.issubset(cities))
